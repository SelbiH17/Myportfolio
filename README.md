 For my Web Technologies assignment, I created my own portfolio website. I struggled the most with making it responsive, as well as with adjusting the margins, padding, and margin-top for images and paragraphs. On the homepage of my portfolio, I added animations to the image and paragraphs, which was also a bit challenging.
